# Introduction
This is a naive program could convert 3D print GCODE tool path to .makerbot format.

So that you can use CURA to slice your 3d model for Makerbot 5th and Makerbot Z18 which has better performance than Makebot Desktop in some case.

This program can work on Z18 but author don't ensure if the program could DAMAGE or BOOM your printer.

So, please try and improve it with your brave heart.
